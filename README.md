# Malware-Detection

This is a 2-student group project for CS5242 Neural Networks and Deep Learning taken under my Master of Science in Business Analytics Course in NUS. The codes are predominantly written and compiled by me while my groupmate and I shared the credit for formulating the approach and running the models. The project report is also included to explain the approach and results obtained. As this is a course on neural networks, multilayer perceptrons (deep, fully connected neural networks) were the main models used. Other machine learning algorithms were not considered other than the use of support vector machine for model ensembling. Data was not included as distribution was not allowed.
