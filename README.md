# Malware-Detection

This is a 2-student group project for CS5242 Neural Networks and Deep Learning taken under the Master of Science in Business Analytics Course in NUS. The codes were predominantly written and compiled by me while my groupmate and I shared the credit for formulating the approach and running the models. The project report is also included to explain the approach and results obtained. As this is a course on neural networks, multilayer perceptrons (deep, fully connected neural networks) were the main models used. Other machine learning algorithms were not considered other than the use of support vector machine for model ensembling. Data used were not included as distribution was not allowed.

data.py: read train.csv, train_label.csv and test.csv for data pre-processing(feature selection, normalization etc)
models.py: specifications for 10 neural network models 
train.py: reads from data.py and models.py to train all 10 neural network models
predict.py: reads from data.py and models.py to predict from neural network models and perform stacking using SVM. Outputs predictions file for kaggle submission
